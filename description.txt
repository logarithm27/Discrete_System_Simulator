// 'E':events, 'D': Events' description, 'X':States, bounds = (x,y,z), n = max number of states; initial_state or init_state : the initial state of the model
// the initial state should appear in the set of states 'X'
// if you don't designate the initial_state, the first element in the set of states 'X' will be considered as the initial state by the program
// max_bounds stands for the maximum values that the x,y and z coordinates can take
// min_bounds stands for the minimum values that the x,y and z coordinates can take
// N can be designated by the user, if not, the program can give a default value
// all components of the file are not case-sensitive you can wirte in lower or upper case
// "..." in the set 'X' stands for infinite number of states (you have the choice to write it)
// you can write the description in different ways :
// d= {event:(x,y),..} or [[event,(x,y)],[],..] or event,(x,y),.. or event:(x,y),..
// each element should appear only once, i.e: you cannot have two set of events 'E', except for the sets of durations lambda's, you can have more than one (depends to your events)
// comments are allowed after a double forward slash '//'
// if there's an error in your description, the program will warn you
